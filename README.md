### Why are we doing this?

To practice and master our learning is the past 4 weeks, also to demonstrate time management with other work tasks.

### How I expected the challenge to go.

The project is a good way to exibit my learing levels after 4 weeks of NBS DevOps TDP trainning.

### What went well?

I have been able to multi task and have learned to time manage tasks, training and project completion. 

### What didn't go as planned?

I wanted to do the stretch Goals too but the VM crashed 2 hours before the estimated time so i could not compleate as i decided.

### Possible improvements for future challenges.

I have to effectively priortise my worklode with excelent time-managementing skills.
